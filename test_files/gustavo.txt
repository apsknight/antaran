Do you know what's happening upstairs? This is all a result of your former partner. Do you understand now? Do you see why this can't continue? There will be an appropriate response. 

Tyrus told me what's happening - the sick child. I understand your preoccupation, but Jesse, I am running a business. I need you back at the lab to complete the cook. You can return when you're done. It is, as you must know, in both of our best interests. 

I... am very sorry. Is there anything I can do? I am on the board of this hospital. I can recommend doctors. Make sure he gets whatever he needs. The best treatment. How did that happen? This current batch is surely ruined now, correct? Stay with the boy. Tyrus will dump what's there and clean the tanks. You will start a new batch when you are ready to return. Next week. 

What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man. No man at all. A crippled little rata. What a reputation to leave behind. Is that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector. Can I help you sir? What can I do for you? I'm... sorry, I'm not following. I... think that you're confusing me for someone else. Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our email system. I will be happy to refer you to our website. 

I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict. 

Has your condition worsened? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? No, clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? Where is Pinkman now. 

I handle the business operations. With all due respect, Don Eladio. I didn't sell it to them. I gave them samples. I gave them samples to give to you. To introduce you to our product. This product is the drug of the future. It'll triple your profits. Perhaps quadruple. 

Right now, you deal almost exclusively in cocaine. But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico. You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians. They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border. But the lion's share of the profit goes to them, despite your assumption of all the risk. And you keep all the profits. 

Don Eladio, please. I didn't sell anything. I apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting. I merely took the initiative. I meant no insult. 

You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. Do not go near him. Ever. Are you listening to me? What do you say? For now, but he'll come around. In the meantime there's the matter of your brother-in-law. He is a problem you promised to resolve. You have failed. Now is left to me. To deal with him. If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter. I will kill your wife, I will kill your son, I will kill your infant daughter.
