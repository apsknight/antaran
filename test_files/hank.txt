Our next three moves are sitting here and waiting. This here's the job buddy. Ain't all super models and speed boats, you know. Not a lot happening stateside. Hearing rumblings about some big play down south. Lots of bodies apparently. Y'know even by Cartel standards. We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones. 

I mean we're definitely not talking, you know, bathtub crank here, this is a big ass operation. You know, hundred of pounds a week, maybe more. Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar and has a decent set of pipes, I'd say he's my guy. There's this mystery man I've been chasing for the better part of a year. Cooks the purest meth that uh me or anyone else has ever seen. Goes by the name of Heisenberg. Yeah, pretty weird, huh? 

I looked him up it was one of these physicists, one of Hitler's guys, physicist named Werner Heisenberg - real cute huh? Anyway, I figure with a handle like that my guy's gotta be some sort of a, some sort of an of egg head. No offense. And here we go, Gale 'Major Tom' Boetticher. Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking. Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right? That's pretty rare these days, but it does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking. 

That's a recipe for vegan s'mores. There's all kinds of crazy crap in there. He had like a top ten recumbent bicycles, indoor composting tips, all right next to the mother of methamphetamine syntheses. This guy was a uh, man he was a real character. Let me show you something. Right here, the top it says uh... 'to W.W. my star, my perfect silence.' W.W. who do you figure that is, you know? Woodrow Wilson, Willy Wonka... Walter White? 

Sorry, buddy. No can do. Pain is my foot in your ass. Ooh, heyo... pool party! Hey, I don't get the gag, jackoff. Who is this? So... let me get this straight. You got this meth from 'some dude' wearing khaki pants, who - you're 80% sure - had a mustache. And that's it? That's your brain working at full capacity? It means I think your story's bullshit. 

Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos. I must've said Cheetos like ten times. You need me to write it down for you? Well, I'm just saying, y'know, I said Cheetos. Ch-ch-ch sound. Virtually impossible to confuse Cheetos with Fritos it seems to me. Where are you going?

So things are quiet, y'know? Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now. Well, we keep hearing a name. Heisenberg. Lately pretty much every dimebagger we come across. Yeah, I know. Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend. Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding. Come here... closer... Asshole.

I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was. I think your car was there because you were there. Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and I think you know something about that, too. 

Sky, the, um... I know it's none of my business, but uh... keeping him away from the kids? Whoa, whoa, no heavy lifting. I got it. Jesus, what you got in there - cinder blocks? If I have to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for asshole. You? No. Only shooting that you do is into a Kleenex.
